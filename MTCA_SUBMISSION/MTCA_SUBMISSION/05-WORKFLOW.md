# MTCA Workflow (Statistical Inevitability & Rule Z Order)

---

### 1. **Mythic Narrative Ingestion**

- Collect and document all relevant indigenous mythic texts/oral traditions for the target region.
    

---

### 2. **Motif Seeding / Extraction**

- Parse narrative for spatial motifs or symbolic markers.
    
- Reduce each motif to an atomic, mappable seed with explicit rationale.
    
- Log all inclusions/exclusions.
    

---

### 3. **Satellite Triangulation / Feature Mapping**

- Use satellite imagery to **map physical features** that correspond to each mythic seed (e.g., rivers, mounds, geomorphic anomalies).
    
- Link each feature explicitly to its mythic seed.
    
- Document spatial alignment, rationale, and any exclusions.
    

---

### 4. **LIDAR/DEM Scientific Breakdown**

- Independently analyze each mapped feature using LIDAR/DEM.
    
- Confirm or falsify features’ existence, boundaries, and geomorphic plausibility.
    
- **Explicitly reject all candidates not confirmed by LIDAR/DEM.**
    
- Rejection is the default; only statistical outliers (dual-confirmed) advance.

### 5. **Meta-Layer Audit Pipeline**

- **Meta-2:** Audit for minimalism & structure.
    
- **Meta-3:** Normalize schema, enforce spatial reference.
    
- **Meta-4:** Apply domain/constraint rules (ecological, geomorphic, historical).
    
- **Meta-5:** Philosophical/alignment filter (internal epistemic consistency).
    
- **Meta-6:** Final compression and justification (no redundancy, all logic traceable).
    

---

### 6. **Final Output & Documentation**

- Only features validated by both **mythic pattern** and **LIDAR/DEM ground-truth** (per Rule Z) are released.
    
- All decisions, inclusions, and rejections are fully logged and auditable.
    

---

**Key Principle:**

- **Rule Z:** No hypothesis is accepted unless it is **first triangulated via myth and satellite, then independently confirmed (or rejected) by LIDAR/DEM**—and only then subjected to meta-layer audit.

**Summary Table:**

| Step                | Input               | Output/Filter                                       | Rule Z Enforcement               |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Mythic Narrative    | Raw myth            | Parsed motifs/seeds                                 | Only spatially relevant motifs   |
| Seeding/Extraction  | Motifs              | Atomic, mappable seeds                              | Explicit rationale for all seeds |
| Satellite Mapping   | Seeds + imagery     | Candidate features mapped to seeds                  | Only spatially aligned features  |
| LIDAR/DEM Breakdown | Features            | Confirmed/rejected by ground-truth                  | Only DEM-confirmed features      |
| Meta-Layer Audit    | DEM-confirmed feats | Meta-2 to 6: minimalism, schema, constraints, etc.  | Each meta-layer is an audit gate |
| Final Output        | Surviving features  | Statistically inevitable, dual-confirmed hypotheses | Only outliers released           |
