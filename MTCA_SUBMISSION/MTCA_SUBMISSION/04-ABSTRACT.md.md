## Abstract

The **Mythic Terrain Compression Auditor (MTCA)** is a seven-layer, recursively auditable protocol for generating statistically inevitable archaeological hypotheses from indigenous myth, satellite imagery, and high-resolution terrain data (LIDAR/DEM).
MTCA operates by extracting symbolic “seeds” from myth, mapping and compressing geospatial features into atomic, testable units, and filtering every candidate through a rigorous, multi-stage audit pipeline—spanning motif extraction, cross-domain alignment, schema normalization, domain constraint enforcement, philosophical alignment, and final justification.

**Key Guarantees:**

- **Statistical inevitability:** No hypothesis is released unless it passes independent validation by both mythic pattern correspondence _and_ direct LIDAR/DEM ground-truthing—driving false positives to near-zero.
- **Total transparency:** All inclusions, exclusions, and rationales are fully documented, human- and AI-auditable.
- **Domain-agnostic meta-system:** MTCA’s protocol generalizes to any field demanding recursive audit, compression, and cross-domain validation (e.g., science, law, AI safety).

**Critical Bottleneck Call-Out:**  
LIDAR/DEM analysis is never used to “support” ambiguous motifs; it _independently_ falsifies or confirms all candidate features. Rejection is the default—acceptance is a statistical outlier, not the norm.

*Demonstrated on two Amazonian case studies, MTCA yielded strict null results, validating its resistance to false positives and auditability under real-world conditions.*
