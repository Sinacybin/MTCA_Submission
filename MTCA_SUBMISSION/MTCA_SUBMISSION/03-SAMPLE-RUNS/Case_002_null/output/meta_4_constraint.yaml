## Meta-4: Domain Constraints & Rule Enforcement

**Quick Explanation:**  
All schema-validated features from Meta-3 were assessed for ecological, geomorphic, and historical plausibility.  
**No candidates advanced to this stage**; all motif seeds were previously excluded.  
No domain or measurement analysis performed. All exclusions are fully documented and rationale cross-referenced.

## Candidates YAML

``` yaml
meta_4_constrained:   candidates: []   exclusions:     - seed: "anaconda movement = river formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3: only standard river morphology detected; failed all prior audit gates."     - seed: "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3: no geomorphically unique lagoon/depression; failed all prior audit gates."     - seed: "anaconda coil = island creation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3: no island feature detected or supported by DEM; failed all prior audit gates."     - seed: "anaconda becomes guardian of water"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3: no geomorphically unique feature or deep basin detected; failed all prior audit gates."   summary: "No candidates advanced to domain constraint audit; all motif seeds were previously excluded at Meta-1/2/3."   input_source: "meta_3_schema.yaml"

> 
> 1. Review schema-normalized outputs in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/output/meta_3_schema.yaml]].
>     
> 2. Check all domain constraint/filtering decisions in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_4_constraint.log]].
>     
> 3. Follow all features or exclusions through to [[meta_5_alignment.yaml]].
