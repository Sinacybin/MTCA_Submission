## Meta-2: Structural Audit & Minimalism

**Quick Explanation:**  
All motif seeds from Meta-1 were assessed for minimalism, redundancy, structural integrity, and schema compliance.  
Since **no candidates were dual-confirmed or included at Meta-1**, none advance.  
All exclusions are explicit, with audit rationale cross-referenced.

## Candidates YAML

``` yaml
meta_2_validated:   candidates: []   exclusions:     - seed: "anaconda movement = river formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1: only standard river morphology detected; not a unique or dual-confirmed feature."     - seed: "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1: no geomorphically unique lagoon/depression confirmed by DEM."     - seed: "anaconda coil = island creation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1: no island feature detected or supported by DEM."     - seed: "anaconda becomes guardian of water"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1: no geomorphically unique feature or deep basin detected."   summary: "No candidates advanced from Meta-1; all motif seeds failed dual-domain confirmation or structural audit."   input_source: "meta_1_ingest.yaml"
