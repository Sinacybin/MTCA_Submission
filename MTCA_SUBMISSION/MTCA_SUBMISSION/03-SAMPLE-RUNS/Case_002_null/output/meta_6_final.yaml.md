## Meta-6: Final Compression & Justification Layer

**Quick Explanation:**  
All alignment-surviving features from Meta-5 were assessed for minimality, justification, and full audit lineage.  
**No features advanced to this stage**; all motif seeds were previously excluded.  
No hypotheses generated. All exclusions and their rationale are fully documented and traceable.

## Candidates YAML

``` yaml
meta_6_final:   hypotheses: []   exclusions:     - seed: "anaconda movement = river formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3/4/5: only standard river morphology detected; excluded at all prior audit layers."     - seed: "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3/4/5: no geomorphically unique lagoon/depression; excluded at all prior audit layers."     - seed: "anaconda coil = island creation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3/4/5: no island feature detected or supported by DEM; excluded at all prior audit layers."     - seed: "anaconda becomes guardian of water"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3/4/5: no geomorphically unique feature or deep basin detected; excluded at all prior audit layers."   summary: "No hypotheses survived the full MTCA audit pipeline; all motif seeds were excluded prior to final justification."   input_source: "meta_5_alignment.yaml"

### Traceability & Audit Chain

- **Upstream source:** [[meta_5_alignment.yaml]] — Philosophical/alignment filter output
    
- **This file:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/output/meta_6_final.yaml]] — Final compression and justification layer
    
- **Downstream:** End of audit pipeline; hypotheses are ready for reporting or publication
    
- **Audit log:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_6_final.log]] — Final rationale, exclusion lineage, and justification for all included/excluded hypotheses
