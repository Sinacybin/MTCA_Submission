## Meta-3: Schema Enforcement & Spatial Normalization

**Quick Explanation:**  
All validated candidates from Meta-2 were checked for full schema compliance and spatial reference requirements.  
Since **no features advanced from Meta-2**, no entries are available for schema validation or normalization.  
All exclusions and rationale are directly cross-referenced.

## Candidates YAML

``` yaml
meta_3_schema:   candidates: []   exclusions:     - seed: "anaconda movement = river formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2: only standard river morphology detected; not schema-eligible."     - seed: "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2: no geomorphically unique lagoon/depression; not schema-eligible."     - seed: "anaconda coil = island creation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2: no island feature detected or supported by DEM; not schema-eligible."     - seed: "anaconda becomes guardian of water"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2: no geomorphically unique feature or deep basin detected; not schema-eligible."   summary: "No candidates advanced to schema validation; all motif seeds were previously excluded at Meta-1/2."   input_source: "meta_2_validated.yaml"

> **To reproduce, validate, or audit this schema layer:**
> 
> 1. Review prior structural audit results in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/output/meta_2_validated.yaml]].
>     
> 2. Check schema logic, normalization, and all audit steps in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_3_schema.log]].
>     
> 3. Track remaining (or excluded) features through to [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/output/meta_4_constraint.yaml]].
