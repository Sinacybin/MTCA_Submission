## Meta-5: Philosophical & Alignment Filter

**Quick Explanation:**  
All domain-constrained features from Meta-4 were assessed for narrative coherence, non-arbitrariness, and epistemic alignment.  
**No candidates advanced to this stage**; all motif seeds were previously excluded.  
No philosophical or alignment audit performed. All exclusions are fully documented and rationale cross-referenced.

## Candidates YAML

``` yaml
meta_5_alignment:   aligned_features: []   exclusions:     - seed: "anaconda movement = river formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3/4: only standard river morphology detected; excluded prior to alignment audit."     - seed: "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3/4: no geomorphically unique lagoon/depression; excluded prior to alignment audit."     - seed: "anaconda coil = island creation"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3/4: no island feature detected or supported by DEM; excluded prior to alignment audit."     - seed: "anaconda becomes guardian of water"       reason: "Rejected in Meta-1/2/3/4: no geomorphically unique feature or deep basin detected; excluded prior to alignment audit."   summary: "No candidates advanced to philosophical/alignment audit; all motif seeds were previously excluded at Meta-1/2/3/4."   input_source: "meta_4_constrained.yaml"
