## Meta-0: Motif Seed Extraction

**Quick Explanation:**  
This file records all atomic “motif seeds” extracted directly from the input mythic narrative.  
Each chunk is a spatially or symbolically mappable feature, with rationale.  
No mapping, measurement, or interpretation is performed here—only motif extraction for downstream protocol.

## Candidates YAML

```yaml
meta_0_seed:
  extracted_seeds:
    - chunk: "anaconda movement = river formation"
      rationale: "Line: 'slithered across the land, carving the winding rivers' — explicit cause/effect mapping."
    - chunk: "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"
      rationale: "Line: 'forming deep lagoons where it rested' — rest corresponds to lagoon creation."
    - chunk: "anaconda coil = island creation"
      rationale: "Line: 'Where it coiled, islands appeared.'"
    - chunk: "anaconda becomes guardian of water"
      rationale: "Line: 'vanished into the waters, becoming the guardian of all depths.'"
  exclusions:
    - note: "No ambiguous motifs detected; all major spatial transformations mapped."
  input_source: "input-myth.md"
```
