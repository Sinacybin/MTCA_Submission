## Input-Myth.md

**Quick Explanation:**  
This file contains the unprocessed mythic narrative serving as primary input for the MTCA protocol.  
No extraction or mapping occurs here—this is the canonical Amazonian anaconda creation myth, as preserved among the Yagua, Ticuna, and neighboring peoples.  
All motif extraction is handled in meta_0_seed.yaml.

**Mythic Narrative (Case 1):**

In the beginning, a colossal anaconda descended from the sky and slithered across the land, carving the winding rivers and forming deep lagoons where it rested. Where it coiled, islands appeared. The anaconda vanished into the waters, becoming the guardian of all depths. The Amazon landscape bears the memory of the anaconda’s movement.

**Note to Reviewers:**  
This is the same canonical mythic narrative used in Case 1. For Case 2, the MTCA protocol applies the identical motif extraction process to a distinct spatial region or candidate feature. This approach demonstrates the protocol’s reproducibility, spatial specificity, and audit discipline when testing identical motifs in different locations.
