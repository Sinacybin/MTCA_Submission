MTCA Case 2: meta_2_audit.log

- Input: output/meta_1_ingest.yaml
- Analyst: Simon Martin
- Date: 2025-06-28

Protocol Step:
  • Performed structural audit and schema validation on all motif seeds referenced in meta_1_ingest.yaml.
  • No candidates met dual-domain confirmation or minimalism requirements for advancement.
  • All seeds were excluded and explicitly documented with rationale.

Audit Results:
  • "anaconda movement = river formation" — Excluded (only standard river morphology detected; not a unique or dual-confirmed feature).
  • "anaconda rest = lagoon formation" — Excluded (no geomorphically unique lagoon/depression confirmed by DEM).
  • "anaconda coil = island creation" — Excluded (no island feature detected or supported by DEM).
  • "anaconda becomes guardian of water" — Excluded (no geomorphically unique feature or deep basin detected).

Notes:
  • This null result reflects strict Rule Z enforcement, rigorous audit, and protocol discipline.
  • All decisions and exclusion rationale are directly cross-referenced in meta_2_validated.yaml.

> **To audit this step:**
> 
> 1. Check dual-domain mapping results in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/logs/meta_1_ingest.log]].
>     
> 2. Review all structural audit decisions and rationale in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/logs/meta_2_validated.log]].
>     
> 3. Track schema enforcement steps in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/logs/meta_3_schema.log]].
