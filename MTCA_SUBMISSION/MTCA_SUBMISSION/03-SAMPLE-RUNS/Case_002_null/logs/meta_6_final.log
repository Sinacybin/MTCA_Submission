MTCA Case 2: meta_6_final.log

- Input: output/meta_5_alignment.yaml
- Analyst: Simon Martin
- Date: 2025-06-28

Protocol Step:
  • Performed final compression, deduplication, and justification review on all features advanced from meta_5_alignment.yaml.
  • No features advanced to this stage; all motif seeds were excluded upstream for failure to survive dual-domain and subsequent audit layers.
  • No hypotheses generated; all exclusions are explicitly documented.

Final Compression & Justification Results:
  • Null result—no hypotheses survived the full MTCA audit pipeline.
  • All motif seeds are listed in exclusions, with explicit reference to the point of exclusion in meta_6_final.yaml.

Notes:
  • This null result demonstrates strict adherence to Rule Z; pipeline auditability and epistemic discipline maintained.
  • All logic and exclusion lineage are fully documented in meta_6_final.yaml.

End of log.

### Traceability & Audit Chain

- **Upstream source:** [[meta_5_alignment.yaml]] — Philosophical/alignment filter output
    
- **This file:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/output/meta_6_final.yaml]] — Final compression and justification layer
    
- **Downstream:** End of audit pipeline; hypotheses are ready for reporting or publication
    
- **Audit log:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/logs/meta_6_final.log]] — Final rationale, exclusion lineage, and justification for all included/excluded hypotheses
