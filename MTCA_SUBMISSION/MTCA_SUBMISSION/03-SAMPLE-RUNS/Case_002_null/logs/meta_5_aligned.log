MTCA Case 2: meta_5_alignment.log

- Input: output/meta_4_constrained.yaml
- Analyst: Simon Martin
- Date: 2025-06-28

Protocol Step:
  • Performed philosophical and epistemic alignment audit on all features advanced from meta_4_constrained.yaml.
  • No candidates advanced to this stage; all motif seeds were excluded upstream.
  • No alignment audit was required or performed.

Alignment Audit Results:
  • Null result—no features present for philosophical/alignment evaluation.
  • All original seeds trace their exclusion lineage to prior audit layers.

Notes:
  • This null result is expected under strict Rule Z enforcement and protocol discipline.
  • All logic and audit lineage are fully documented in meta_4_constrained.yaml and meta_5_alignment.yaml.

End of log.

**Traceability & Audit Chain**

- **Upstream source:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/logs/meta_4_constraint.log]] — Domain constraint audit
    
- **This log:** [[meta_5_alignment.log]] — Philosophical and epistemic alignment audit
    
- **Downstream audit:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/logs/meta_6_final.log]] — Final compression and justification audit
    

> **To audit this step:**
> 
> 1. Check domain constraint outcomes in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/logs/meta_4_constraint.log]].
>     
> 2. Review alignment/audit logic in [[meta_5_alignment.log]].
>     
> 3. Follow final hypothesis evaluation and justification in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_002_null/logs/meta_6_final.log]].
