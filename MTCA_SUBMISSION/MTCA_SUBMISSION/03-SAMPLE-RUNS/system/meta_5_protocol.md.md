# **Meta-5 Protocol: Philosophical & Alignment Filter**

## Purpose

To apply an explicit philosophical audit: each surviving feature must align with the project’s epistemic standards (truth, non-arbitrariness, narrative integrity), ensuring no inclusion drifts from system axioms or introduces misalignment.

## Required Inputs

- `/output/meta_4_constrained.yaml` (features passing domain constraints)
    
- `/logs/meta_4_constrained.log`
    

## Output Files

- `/output/meta_5_alignment.yaml` (features surviving philosophical audit)
    
- `/logs/meta_5_alignment.log` (alignment decisions and rationale)
    

## Stepwise Protocol

1. **Ingest Constrained Features**
    
    - Read all features from `/output/meta_4_constrained.yaml`.
        
2. **Alignment Evaluation**
    
    - For each feature:
        
        - Assess for **narrative coherence** (matches mythic intent and pattern logic).
            
        - Ensure **non-arbitrariness** (rationale and evidence are non-circular, non-tautological).
            
        - Enforce **epistemic standards** (truth, precision, auditability).
            
    - Exclude any feature violating these principles; log reason.
        
3. **Document All Decisions**
    
    - Record alignment pass/fail and rationale for each feature in `/logs/meta_5_alignment.log`.
        
4. **Save Output**
    
    - Output all alignment-surviving features to `/output/meta_5_alignment.yaml`:
        
        yaml
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `meta_5_alignment:   aligned_features:     - chunk: "anaconda movement = river formation"       rationale: "Narratively coherent, non-arbitrary, truth-aligned."   exclusions:     - chunk: "sinuous river channel, 2,900 m arc"       reason: "Rejected: rationale is circular; fails alignment."   summary: "Only philosophically and epistemically aligned features survive."   input_source: "meta_4_constrained.yaml"`
        
5. **Audit Completeness**
    
    - Verify presence and reference of all output, log, and input files.

### Failure Examples: What Does _Not_ Pass Meta-5

|Type|Example Entry|Reason for Exclusion|
|---|---|---|
|Narrative Drift|`chunk`: “river curve, maybe inspired by myth”|Does not map to explicit mythic intent|
|Circular Logic|Rationale: “This is true because the data matches”|Rationale is circular; no independent evidence|
|Tautology|Rationale: “It is what it is”|Fails epistemic standards; not falsifiable|
|Unaligned|Rationale contradicts core project axiom (e.g., uses myth metaphorically when literal required)|Fails alignment to protocol/axioms|
|Audit Fail|Rationale: “Expert opinion” only, with no evidence|Fails auditability and epistemic transparency|

**No feature advances without narrative coherence, non-arbitrariness, and full epistemic alignment.**
