# **Meta-6 Protocol: Final Compression & Justification Layer**

## Purpose

To compress all surviving features into a minimal, justification-rich set of hypotheses—removing any residual redundancy, ambiguity, or non-traceable logic. This is the final audit, producing only those hypotheses that are _statistically inevitable_ and fully auditable.

## Required Inputs

- `/output/meta_5_alignment.yaml` (aligned features)
    
- `/logs/meta_5_alignment.log`
    

## Output Files

- `/output/meta_6_final.yaml` (final hypotheses, fully justified)
    
- `/logs/meta_6_final.log` (final audit trace)
    

## Stepwise Protocol

1. **Ingest Alignment-Surviving Features**
    
    - Read all from `/output/meta_5_alignment.yaml`.
        
2. **Compression & Deduplication**
    
    - Remove any residual overlap, micro-redundancy, or unnecessary distinctions.
        
    - Ensure only the most compressed (irreducible), evidence-rich hypotheses remain.
        
3. **Justification Layer**
    
    - For each surviving hypothesis:
        
        - Attach a concise, maximal-clarity justification (why this feature is inevitable given all prior evidence and audit steps).
            
        - Ensure lineage is traceable back to original mythic seed and each meta-layer.
            
4. **Document All Decisions**
    
    - Log all inclusions, final compressions, and any last exclusions with reason in `/logs/meta_6_final.log`.
        
5. **Save Output**
    
    - Output the final set to `/output/meta_6_final.yaml`:
        
        yaml
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `meta_6_final:   hypotheses:     - chunk: "anaconda movement = river formation"       justification: "Statistically inevitable; survived all narrative, scientific, domain, and philosophical audits with explicit lineage."   exclusions: []   summary: "Final compressed and justified set; statistical inevitability enforced."   input_source: "meta_5_alignment.yaml"`
        
6. **Audit Completeness**
    
    - Confirm presence of all referenced files.

### Failure Examples: What Does _Not_ Pass Meta-6

|Type|Example Entry|Reason for Exclusion|
|---|---|---|
|Residual Redundancy|Two features both describe the same river arc|Only the most compressed/irreducible is retained|
|Weak Justification|`justification`: “Seems likely, but not certain”|Only statistical inevitability and complete audit trail allowed|
|Ambiguity|`chunk`: “possible site, see prior evidence”|Not direct, unique, or fully justified|
|Lineage Break|Feature cannot be traced through every meta-layer|All hypotheses must be recursively traceable|
|Unjustified Inclusion|Included for “balance” or reviewer preference|Only evidence-driven, necessity-proven features survive|

**Only statistically inevitable, fully justified, and lineage-traceable hypotheses are released.**
