## Overview

**Case Study:** MTCA Application – Amazonian Anaconda Myth (Case 1)

This folder documents the full audit pipeline for Case 1 of the Mythic Terrain Compression Auditor (MTCA).  
Case 1 applies the complete MTCA system to the canonical Amazonian Anaconda creation myth, using satellite and LIDAR/DEM imagery from a specific Amazonian region. The process is fully manual, auditable, and protocol-driven—no automation or black-box steps.

## Input Narrative

**Mythic Input:**  
_Amazonian Anaconda creation myth_

> “In the beginning, a colossal anaconda descended from the sky and slithered across the land, carving the winding rivers and forming deep lagoons where it rested. Where it coiled, islands appeared. The anaconda vanished into the waters, becoming the guardian of all depths. The Amazon landscape bears the memory of the anaconda’s movement.”

**Reference:**  
Traditional Amazonian creation myth (Yagua, Ticuna, et al.; see Santos-Granero 2009, Roosevelt 2013).

## Region / Data

- **Target Region:** Segment of the Amazon basin (see files below)
    
- **Satellite Imagery:** `Case_001_Satellite.png`
    
- **LIDAR/DEM:** `Case_001_LIDAR.png`
    

---

## Motif Seeds Extracted

- anaconda movement = river formation
    
- anaconda rest = lagoon formation
    
- anaconda coil = island creation
    
- anaconda becomes guardian of water
    

(See: `meta_0_seed.yaml`)

## Audit Outcome

All motif seeds were strictly tested against both satellite and LIDAR/DEM data in accordance with MTCA protocol.

**Result:**

> **Strict null result.**  
> No motif seeds were dual-confirmed at Meta-1.  
> All features were excluded and did not advance to further audit layers.  
> This result demonstrates maximal resistance to false positives and full protocol auditability (Rule Z).

## Data & Imagery

- **Satellite Image:** `photos/Case_1_Satellite.png` (public satellite region, Amazon Basin)
    
- **LIDAR/DEM:** `photos/Case_1_LIDAR.png` (public DEM, processed with QGIS for pseudo-color and contours)
    
- **Note:** Images generated from open-access sources (OpenTopography/OpenTopoMap); no proprietary data used. No unique scene/tile ID available—region and methods are documented in the root README.
    

> **Reviewer Note:**  
> All processing steps (export, pseudo-coloring, contour overlay) are fully described in the root README under "Data Sources & Provenance." Raw DEM tiles and step-by-step QGIS instructions are available on request.

## Protocol Notes

- **Rule Z strictly enforced:** No feature is accepted unless dual-confirmed by both mythic narrative and empirical ground-truth.
    
- **Audit discipline:** Every exclusion and rationale is explicit, traceable, and fully logged at each audit layer.
    
- **Null result is expected and desired** in the absence of genuine dual-domain correspondence; this validates MTCA’s robustness against overfitting and narrative drift.
