MTCA Case 1: meta_6_final.log

- Input: output/meta_5_alignment.yaml
- Analyst: Simon Martin
- Date: 2025-06-26

Protocol Step:
  • Performed final compression, deduplication, and justification review on all features advanced from meta_5_alignment.yaml.
  • No features advanced to this stage; all motif seeds were excluded upstream for failure to survive dual-domain and subsequent audit layers.
  • No hypotheses generated; all exclusions are explicitly documented.

Final Compression & Justification Results:
  • Null result—no hypotheses survived the full MTCA audit pipeline.
  • All motif seeds are listed in exclusions, with explicit reference to the point of exclusion in meta_6_final.yaml.

Notes:
  • This null result demonstrates strict adherence to Rule Z; pipeline auditability and epistemic discipline maintained.
  • All logic and exclusion lineage are fully documented in meta_6_final.yaml.

End of log.

**Traceability & Audit Chain**

- **Upstream source:** [[meta_5_alignment.log]] — Philosophical/alignment audit
    
- **This log:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_6_final.log]] — Final compression, deduplication, and justification audit
    
- **Downstream:** End of MTCA pipeline (definitive output for reporting, publication, or peer review)
    

> **To audit this step:**
> 
> 1. Confirm upstream alignment steps in [[meta_5_alignment.log]].
>     
> 2. Review all final compression, exclusion, and justification steps in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_6_final.log]].
>     
> 3. Use this log as definitive provenance for the MTCA case output.
