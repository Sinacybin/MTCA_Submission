MTCA Case 1: meta_4_constraint.log

- Input: output/meta_3_schema.yaml
- Analyst: Simon Martin
- Date: 2025-06-26

Protocol Step:
  • Applied domain-specific constraints, scientific plausibility filters, and exclusion rules to all schema-validated features from meta_3_schema.yaml.
  • No features advanced to this stage; all motif seeds were excluded upstream (no schema-validated candidates present).
  • No domain or measurement analysis performed.

Domain Constraint Results:
  • Null result—no candidates present for constraint audit.
  • All original seeds trace exclusion lineage to previous audit layers.

Notes:
  • This null result is expected under strict Rule Z enforcement and pipeline discipline.
  • All logic and audit lineage are fully documented in meta_3_schema.yaml and meta_4_constraint.yaml.

End of log.

**Traceability & Audit Chain**

- **Upstream source:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_3_schema.log]] — Schema enforcement and normalization audit
    
- **This log:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_4_constraint.log]] — Domain constraint and rule enforcement audit
    
- **Downstream audit:** [[meta_5_alignment.log]] — Philosophical/alignment audit
    

> **To audit this step:**
> 
> 1. Review schema validation steps in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_3_schema.log]].
>     
> 2. Examine domain constraint logic and exclusions in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_4_constraint.log]].
>     
> 3. Track philosophical/alignment filtering in [[meta_5_alignment.log]].
