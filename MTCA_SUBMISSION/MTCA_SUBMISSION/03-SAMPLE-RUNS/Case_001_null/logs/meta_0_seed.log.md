MTCA Case 1: meta_0_seed.log

- Input myth file: data/input-myth.md
- Extraction performed by: Simon Martin
- Date: 2025-06-26

Protocol Step:
  • Parsed narrative for explicit, spatially mappable motifs, excluding all purely metaphorical or ambiguous content.

Extracted Motif Seeds:
  1. "anaconda movement = river formation"
     - Justification: Line—'slithered across the land, carving the winding rivers'
  2. "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"
     - Justification: Line—'forming deep lagoons where it rested'
  3. "anaconda coil = island creation"
     - Justification: Line—'Where it coiled, islands appeared.'
  4. "anaconda becomes guardian of water"
     - Justification: Line—'vanished into the waters, becoming the guardian of all depths.'

Exclusions:
  • No ambiguous, non-mappable, or metaphorical motifs detected in this narrative.
  • All major spatial transformations mapped.

Notes:
  • Extraction logic aligns with Meta-0 protocol: Only atomic, mappable seeds included.
  • All justifications and exclusions directly cross-referenced in meta_0_seed.yaml.
