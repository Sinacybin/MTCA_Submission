MTCA Case 1: meta_3_schema.log

- Input: output/meta_2_validated.yaml
- Analyst: Simon Martin
- Date: 2025-06-26

Protocol Step:
  • Enforced schema normalization and spatial reference requirements for all validated features from meta_2_validated.yaml.
  • No candidates advanced to this stage; all motif seeds were excluded upstream for lack of dual-domain confirmation.
  • No entries available for schema compliance or spatial reference audit.

Audit Results:
  • Null result—no features present for schema validation.

Notes:
  • This result is expected; pipeline coherence is enforced by strict Rule Z protocol.
  • All logic and lineage are traceable in meta_2_validated.yaml.

End of log.

**Traceability & Audit Chain**

- **Upstream source:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_2_validated.log]] — Structural/minimalism audit log
    
- **This log:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_3_schema.log]] — Schema enforcement and spatial normalization audit
    
- **Downstream audit:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_4_constraint.log]] — Domain constraints and rule enforcement audit
    

> **To audit this step:**
> 
> 1. Review structural audit results in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_2_validated.log]].
>     
> 2. Examine all schema normalization and exclusion decisions in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_3_schema.log]].
>     
> 3. Follow domain constraint steps in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_4_constraint.log]].
