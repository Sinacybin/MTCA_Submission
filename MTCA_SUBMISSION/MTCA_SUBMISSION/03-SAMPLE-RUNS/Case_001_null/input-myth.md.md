**Mythic Narrative (Case 1):**

In the beginning, a colossal anaconda descended from the sky and slithered across the land, carving the winding rivers and forming deep lagoons where it rested. Where it coiled, islands appeared. The anaconda vanished into the waters, becoming the guardian of all depths. The Amazon landscape bears the memory of the anaconda’s movement.
