## Meta-6: Final Compression & Justification Layer

**Quick Explanation:**  
This file compresses all surviving features into a minimal, justification-rich set of hypotheses.  
Only statistically inevitable, fully justified, and lineage-traceable hypotheses are included.  
All exclusions and justifications are explicit; this is the final output of the audit pipeline.

## Candidates YAML

```yaml
meta_6_final:
  hypotheses: []
  exclusions:
    - chunk: "anaconda movement = river formation"
      reason: "Excluded upstream; failed dual-domain confirmation (Meta-1)."
    - chunk: "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"
      reason: "Excluded upstream; failed dual-domain confirmation (Meta-1)."
    - chunk: "anaconda coil = island creation"
      reason: "Excluded upstream; failed dual-domain confirmation (Meta-1)."
    - chunk: "anaconda becomes guardian of water"
      reason: "Excluded upstream; failed dual-domain confirmation (Meta-1)."
  summary: "Null result—no hypotheses survived all audit layers; Rule Z enforced throughout."
  input_source: "meta_5_alignment.yaml"
```

### Traceability & Audit Chain

- **Upstream source:** [[meta_5_alignment.yaml]] — Philosophical/alignment filter output
    
- **This file:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/output/meta_6_final.yaml]] — Final compression and justification layer
    
- **Downstream:** End of audit pipeline; hypotheses are ready for reporting or publication
    
- **Audit log:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_6_final.log]] — Final rationale, exclusion lineage, and justification for all included/excluded hypotheses

> 
> 1. Review upstream alignment/audit in [[meta_5_alignment.yaml]].
>     
> 2. Examine all final compression, exclusion, and justification steps in [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_6_final.log]].
>     
> 3. Use this file as the definitive output for reporting, publication, or review.
