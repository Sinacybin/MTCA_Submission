## Meta-2: Structural Audit & Minimalism

**Quick Explanation:**  
This file documents the structural audit of all dual-confirmed candidates from Meta-1.  
Each feature is checked for minimalism, non-redundancy, and schema compliance.  
Only unique, atomic, and structurally sound candidates advance; all others are excluded with explicit rationale.

## Candidates YAML

```yaml
meta_2_validated:
  candidates: []
  exclusions:
    - seed: "anaconda movement = river formation"
      reason: "Rejected in Meta-1: standard river only; no dual-domain anomaly."
    - seed: "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"
      reason: "Rejected in Meta-1: no lagoon detected."
    - seed: "anaconda coil = island creation"
      reason: "Rejected in Meta-1: no island detected."
    - seed: "anaconda becomes guardian of water"
      reason: "Rejected in Meta-1: no unique depth/basin detected."
  summary: "No candidates advanced from Meta-1; all motif seeds rejected for lack of dual-domain confirmation."
  input_source: "meta_1_ingest.yaml"
```

### Traceability & Audit Chain

- **This file:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/output/meta_2_validated.yaml]] — Structural/minimalism audit
    
- **Downstream mapping:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/output/meta_3_schema.yaml]] — Schema enforcement and spatial normalization
    
- **Audit log:** [[MTCA_SUBMISSION/03-SAMPLE-RUNS/Case_001_null/logs/meta_2_validated.log]] — Step-by-step logic for all structural inclusions/exclusions
