## Meta-5: Philosophical & Alignment Filter

**Quick Explanation:**  
This file applies the philosophical audit to all domain-constrained features from Meta-4.  
Each feature is checked for narrative coherence, non-arbitrariness, and epistemic alignment.  
Only philosophically and epistemically aligned features advance; all exclusions are explicit with rationale.

## Candidates YAML

```yaml
meta_5_alignment:
  aligned_features: []
  exclusions:
    - chunk: "anaconda movement = river formation"
      reason: "No features advanced; excluded upstream (Meta-4)."
    - chunk: "anaconda rest = lagoon formation"
      reason: "No features advanced; excluded upstream (Meta-4)."
    - chunk: "anaconda coil = island creation"
      reason: "No features advanced; excluded upstream (Meta-4)."
    - chunk: "anaconda becomes guardian of water"
      reason: "No features advanced; excluded upstream (Meta-4)."
  summary: "Null result—no features reached philosophical/alignment filter; all were excluded in the previous audit layer."
  input_source: "meta_4_constraint.yaml"
